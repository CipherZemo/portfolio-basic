# Personal Portfolio with Theme Switcher
This project entails building a professional, fully-responsive personal portfolio website from the ground up. The core of this project is not just to showcase your skills and projects, but to demonstrate your mastery of modern front-end fundamentals: semantic HTML, advanced CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The standout feature will be a dynamic light/dark theme switcher, allowing users to toggle the site's appearance. We will enhance this project beyond a simple static page by adding a dynamically rendered project section from a JavaScript data structure, a functional contact form using a third-party service, and subtle animations for a polished user experience. This project is designed to be a cornerstone of your portfolio, demonstrating practical skills in design, interactivity, accessibility, and deployment, preparing it for future expansion into a full-stack application or a professional business front.
