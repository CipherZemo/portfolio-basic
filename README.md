# Personal Portfolio with Theme Switcher
This project entails building a professional, fully-responsive personal portfolio website from the ground up. The core of this project is not just to showcase your skills and projects, but to demonstrate your mastery of modern front-end fundamentals: semantic HTML, advanced CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The standout feature will be a dynamic light/dark theme switcher, allowing users to toggle the site's appearance. We will enhance this project beyond a simple static page by adding a dynamically rendered project section from a JavaScript data structure, a functional contact form using a third-party service called **Formspree**, and subtle animations for a polished user experience. And also adding an endpoint api to the third party service for form submission and after successful submission instead of redirecting to their site we'll just display sucess on our own page.
